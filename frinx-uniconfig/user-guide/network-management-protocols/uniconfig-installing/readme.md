# Device installation

Installing is the process of loading device information into UniConfig
database. This information is saved in PostgreSQL database and used
whenever transaction occurs. When the transaction is finished the
connection to device is closed again, until next transaction.

These are the steps of installation process:

1.  creation of UniConfig transaction
2.  creation of mountpoint - connection to device
3.  loading configuration and metadata from mountpoint
4.  closing mountpoint and connection to device
5.  storing synced configuration and metadata to database
6.  closing UniConfig transaction

!!!
Node can be installed only once (you will receive error if node has
already been installed).
!!!

You can specify if you would like to install node on the UniConfig
layer. Default value is 'true':  

```
uniconfig-config:install-uniconfig-node-enabled
```

Only 1 node with the same node-id can be installed on UniConfig layer.

It is synchronous: it succeeds only after node is successfully installed
it fails in other cases – **max-connection-attempts** is automatically
set to value '1', if different value is not provided in RPC input, database or config file.

Following sections provide deeper explanation of parameters needed for
installation, along with example install requests.

## Default parameters
All install parameters (CLI/NETCONF) are set in database when Uniconfig is initializing. 
Values of these parameters are equal to specific yang model default values. 
These parameters are used when they are missing in RPC request.

Priority of using install parameters : 
1. Parameter set in install RPC request
2. Parameter set in database
3. Default parameter from yang model

Priority of initial writing default parameters into database:
1. Database already contains default parameters
2. User defines default parameters into config file
3. Default values from yang schema file will be saved

Default parameters can be managed (read/update) using RESTCONF/Uniconfig shell
with [UniConfig Cloud Config](../../uniconfig-operations/uniconfig-properties).

Default parameters can also be defined in the **application.properties.json**
file located in the `config` directory.

## Installing CLI device


![Install node RPC](install-node.png)

List of basic connection parameters that are used for identification of
remote device. All of these parameters are mandatory.

- **node-id** - Name of node that represents device in the topology.
- **cli-topology:host** - IP address or domain-name of target device that runs SSH or Telnet server.
- **cli-topology:port** - TCP port on which the SSH or Telnet server on remote device is listening to incoming connections. Standard SSH
     port is '22', standard Telnet port is '23'.
- **cli-topology:transport-type** - Application protocol used for communication with device - supported options are 'ssh' and 'telnet'.
- **cli-topology:device-type** - Device type that is used for selection of translation units that maps device configuration to OpenConfig models. Supported devices can
     be found
- **cli-topology:device-version** - Version of device. Use a specific
    version or \* for a generic one. \* enables only basic read and
    write management without the support of OpenConfig models.
    [Here](https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/supported-devices.html).
- **cli-topology:username** - Username for accessing of CLI management
    line.
- **cli-topology:password** - Password assigned to username.
- **uniconfig-config:install-uniconfig-node-enabled** - Whether node
    should be installed to UniConfig and unified layers. By default,
    this flag is set to 'true'.

### Authentication parameters

List of authentication parameters used for identification of remote user
utilized for configuration of the device. Username and password
parameters are mandatory.

- **cli-topology:username** - Username for accessing of CLI management line.
- **cli-topology:password** - Password assigned to username.

List of parameters that can be used for adjusting of reconnection
strategy. None of these parameters is mandatory - if they are not set,
default values are set. There are two exclusive groups of parameters
based on selected reconnection strategy - you can define only parameters
from single group. By default, keepalive strategy is used.

### Connection parameters

Following parameters adjust maintaining of CLI session state. 
None of these parameters are mandatory (default values will be used).

-   **cli-topology:max-connection-attempts** - Maximum number of initial connection attempts 
    (default value: 1). If there are unstable devices in the network it might be useful 
    to provide `max-connection-attempts` higher than the default value. It would try to connect
    `n` times before throwing an ssh connection exception.
-   **cli-topology:max-connection-attempts-install** - Maximum number of initial connection attempts during install
    process (default value: 1). If there are unstable devices in the network it might be useful
    to provide `max-connection-attempts-install` higher than the default value. It would try to connect
    `n` times before throwing an ssh connection exception.
-   **cli-topology:max-reconnection-attempts** - Maximum number of reconnection attempts
    (default value: 1). `max-reconnection-attempts` is not that necessary to set. Uniconfig does
    not keep idle sessions open longer than it is necessary.

### Storing failed installations

The following parameter allows the user to store the installation in case the device is in some way unreachable.

- **uniconfig-config:store-failed-installation** - If enabled, it will ensure that even if the device is unreachable, 
    it will be stored in the node table in the database. If not set, the default value is false.

When the user sets the flag to true, an additional column called **installation-status** will be populated with a boolean 
flag (either **SUCCESSFUL** for a successful installation, or **FAILED** for a failed one). This lets the user know that 
there has been some problem and that the device was not installed correctly. The mount-point information of that node 
will be stored (unlike with the default value). With this info already stored, the user does not need to reinstall the 
device, as all the connection information is present in the UniConfig database. Syncing the device or calling a GET 
Request will try to reconnect to the device and if it is successful, the configuration data will be saved in the 
datastore and the request will then finish. The **installation-status** will then change to **SUCCESSFUL**. The installed device 
will then behave normally as if the installation was successful in the first place. If the device is still unreachable, 
the flag will stay **FAILED**. 

This is useful when many devices are being installed in batches and the user doesn't know if they are up or not.

### Keepalive strategies

**1. Keepalive reconnection strategy**

-   **cli-topology:keepalive-delay** - Delay between sending of
     keepalive messages over CLI session. The value should not be set higher than 
     the execution of the longest operation. Default value: 60 seconds.
-   **cli-topology:keepalive-timeout** - This parameter defines how
     much time the CLI layer should wait for a response to keepalive message
     before the session is closed. Default value: 60 seconds.
-   **cli-topology:keepalive-initial-delay** - This parameter defines
     how much time CLI layer waits for establishment of new CLI session
     before the first reconnection attempt is launched. Default value:
     120 seconds.

The keepalive parameters have two main functions:

-   keep the idle session open
-   timeout commands which would block the session forever

### Example of using the connection and keepalive parameters together

For this example let us assume that we are dealing with a prod-like device, which would mean that
some devices might have a large config. We would set these parameters:

```properties
max-connection-attempts=3
max-reconnection-attempts=3
keepalive-delay=120
keepalive-timeout=120
```

Connection attempts would give us more flexibility if we work with unstable devices. It would
try to ssh 3 times instead of 1 (default value). We should also keep in mind that the process of
connecting to a device would take longer because of extra ssh attempts.

Keepalive commands can be set less than time of the installation, because keepalive commands can
fit in between of the installation process. An important thing to keep in mind is to set sum of
keepalive-delay and keepalive-timeout parameters higher than time of execution of the configuration
show command. Otherwise, it could time out during writing out of the configuration to the console.
For each type of device it is a different command (`configuration show brief` for Ciena devices,
`show run` for Cisco devices, etc.). 
Assumption is that it should not take more than 240 seconds (sum of keepalive params) to show the
whole configuration. This can be appropriately adjusted to our circumstances.

**2. Lazy reconnection strategy**

-   **command-timeout** - Maximal time (in seconds) for command
     execution. If a command cannot be executed on a device in this
     time, the execution is considered a failure. Default value: 60
     seconds.
-   **connection-establish-timeout** - Maximal time (in seconds) for
     connection establishment. If a connection attempt fails in this
     time, the attempt is considered a failure. Default value: 60
     seconds.
-   **connection-lazy-timeout** - Maximal time (in seconds) for
     connection to keep alive. If no activity was detected in the
     session and the timeout has been reached, connection will be
     stopped. Default value: 60 seconds.

### Journaling parameters

The following parameters relate with tracing of executed commands. It is
not required to set these parameters.

-   **cli-topology:journal-size** - Size of the cli mount-point journal.
    Journal keeps track of executed commands and makes them available
    for users/apps for debugging purposes. Value 0 disables journaling
    (it is default value).
-   **cli-topology:dry-run-journal-size** - Creates dry-run mount-point
    and defines number of commands in command history for dry-run
    mount-point. Value 0 disables dry-run functionality (it is default
    value).
-   **cli-topology:journal-level** - Sets how much information should be
    stored in the journal. Option 'command-only' stores only the actual
    commands executed on device. Option 'extended' records additional
    information such as: transaction life-cycle, which handlers were
    invoked etc.

### Parsing parameters

Parsing strategies are used for:

-   Recognizing of structure in cached device configuration that is
    represented in textual format.
-   Extraction of target sections from structured format of device
    configuration.

Parsing engine can be configured on creation of mountpoint by
specification of **parsing-engine** leaf value. Currently, there are three
supported CLI parsing strategies: **tree-parser** (default strategy), **batch-parser** and **one-line-parser**.

!!!
Both batch-parser and tree-parser depend on current implementation of
'CliFlavour' which defines device-specific CLI patterns. For example,
if 'CliFlavour' doesn't correctly specify format of 'show
configuration' command, then neither batch-parser or tree-parser is
applied and commands are sent directly to device.
!!!

#### Tree-parser

- It is set as default parsing engine in case you choose to not use
    'parsing-engine' parameter.
- Running-configuration is mapped into the tree structure before the
    first command lookup is executed from translation unit. Afterwards,
    this tree can be reused in the same transaction for faster lookup
    process (for example, one 'sync-from-network' task is executed in
    one transaction).
- Tree-parser is faster than batch-parser in most cases because device
    configuration must be traversed only once and searching for target
    section in parsed tree structure has only logarithmic time
    complexity. The longer the device configuration is, the better
    performance improvement is achieved using this parsing strategy.
- Both batch-parser and tree-parser should be capable to parse the
    same device configurations (in other words, tree-parser doesn't have
    any functional restrictions in comparison to batch-parser).

#### Batch-parser

- Running-configuration must be traversed from the beginning each time
    when new target section is extracted from the configuration (such
    lookup process is launched from CLI translation units).
- Internally, this parser uses regular expressions to recognize
    structure of configuration and find target section. From this
    reason, if configuration is long, this batch-parser becomes
    ineffective to extract sections that are placed near the end of
    device configuration.
- Batch-parser should be used only as fallback strategy in the case
    when tree-parser fails.

#### One-line-parser

- CLI parsing engine that stores configuration in the cache in the
    form of blocks and then uses grep function for parsing
    running-configuration

## Installing Netconf device


### Identification of remote device

List of basic connection parameters that are used for identification of
remote device. Only **tcp-only** parameter must not be specified in input
of the request.

- **node-id** - Name of node that represents device / mount-point in
    the topology.
- **netconf-node-topology:host** - IP address or domain-name of target
    device that runs NETCONF server.
- **netconf-node-topology:port** - TCP port on which NETCONF server is
    listening to incoming connections.
- **netconf-node-topology:tcp-only** - If it is set to 'true', NETCONF
    session is created directly on top of TCP connection. Otherwise,
    'SSH' is used as carriage protocol. By default, this parameter is
    set to 'false'.

### Authentication parameters

Parameters used for configuration of the basic authentication method
against NETCONF server. These parameters must be specified in the input
request.

- **network-topology:username** - Name of the user that has permission
    to access device using NETCONF management line.
- **network-topology:password** - Password to the user in
    non-encrypted format.

!!!
There are also other authentication parameters if different
authentication method is used - for example, key-based authentication
requires specification of key-id. All available authentication
parameters can be found in **netconf-node-topology.yang** under
**netconf-node-credentials** grouping.
!!!

### Session timers

The following parameters adjust timers that are related with maintaining
of NETCONF session state. None of these parameters are mandatory
(default values will be used).

- **netconf-node-topology:initial-connection-timeout** - Specifies timeout in seconds after which initial connection to the NETCONF server must be established (default value: 20 s).
- **netconf-node-topology:request-transaction-timeout** - Timeout for blocking RPC operations within transactions (default value: 60 s).
- **netconf-node-topology:max-connection-attempts** - Maximum number of connection attempts (default value: 1).
- **netconf-node-topology:max-reconnection-attempts** - Maximum number of reconnection attempts (default value: 0 - disabled).
- **netconf-node-topology:between-attempts-timeout** - Initial timeout between reconnection attempts (default value: 2 s).
- **netconf-node-topology:reconnenction-attempts-multiplier** - Multiplier between subsequent delays of reconnection attempts (default value: 1.5).
- **netconf-node-topology:keepalive-delay** - Delay between sending of keepalive RPC messages (default value: 120 sec).
- **netconf-node-topology:confirm-commit-timeout** - The timeout for confirming the configuration by "confirming-commit" that was configured by "confirmed-commit". Configuration will be automatically reverted by device if the "confirming-commit" is not issued within the timeout period. This parameter has effect only on NETCONF nodes. (default value: 600 sec).


### Capabilities

Parameters related to capabilities are often used when NETCONF device
doesn't provide list of YANGs. Both parameters are optional.

- **netconf-node-topology:yang-module-capabilities** - Set a list of
    capabilities to override capabilities provided in device's hello
    message. It can be used for devices that do not report any yang
    modules in their hello message.
- **netconf-node-topology:non-module-capabilities** - Set a list of
    non-module based capabilities to override or merge non-module
    capabilities provided in device's hello message. It can be used for
    devices that do not report or incorrectly report non-module-based
    capabilities in their hello message.

!!!
Instead of defining **netconf-node-topology:yang-module-capabilities**,
we can just define folder with yang schemas
**netconf-node-topology:schema-cache-directory**: **folder-name**. For
more information about using the
**netconf-node-topology:schema-cache-directory** parameter, see
RST Other parameters.
!!!

### UniConfig-native

Parameters related to installation of NETCONF or CLI nodes with
uniconfig-native support.

- **uniconfig-config:uniconfig-native-enabled** - Whether
    uniconfig-native should be used for installation of NETCONF or CLI
    node. By default, this flag is set to 'false'.
- **uniconfig-config:install-uniconfig-node-enabled** - Whether node
    should be installed to UniConfig and unified layers. By default,
    this flag is set to 'true'.
- **uniconfig-config:sequence-read-active** - Force sequential data reading when mounting a device. If set to 'true', sync-from-network is done in parallel. The default value is 'false'.
- **uniconfig-config:whitelist** - List of root YANG entities that should be read.
- **uniconfig-config:blacklist** - List of root YANG entities that
    should not be read from NETCONF device due to incompatibility with
    uniconfig-native or other malfunctions in YANG schemas. This
    parameter has effect only on NETCONF nodes.
- **uniconfig-config:validation-enabled** - Whether validation RPC
    should be used before submitting configuration of node. By default,
    this flag is set to 'true'. This parameter has effect only on
    NETCONF nodes.
- **uniconfig-config:confirmed-commit-enabled** - Whether
    confirmed-commit RPC should be used before submitting configuration
    of node. By default, this flag is set to 'true'. This parameter has
    effect only on NETCONF nodes.
- **uniconfig-config:store-failed-installation** - Whether the installation
    should be stored in the database if it fails (e.g. is unreachable).
    The node will be 'installed' even though it failed and the user has 2 options:
  - uninstall the device and reinstall it.
  - call sync-from-network to sync the data from the device.


### Flags
Non-mandatory flag parameters that can be added to mount-request.

- **netconf-node-topology:enabled-strict-parsing** - Default value of enabled-strict-parsing parameter is set to 'true'. This may inflicts in throwing exception during parsing of received NETCONF messages in case of unknown elements. If this parameter is set to 'false', then parser should ignore unknown elements and not throw exception during parsing.
- **netconf-node-topology:enabled-notifications** - Default value of enabled-notifications is set to 'true'. If it is set to 'true' and NETCONF device supports notifications, NETCONF mountpoint will expose NETCONF notification and subscription services.
- **netconf-node-topology:reconnect-on-changed-schema** - Default value of reconnect-on-changed-schema is set to 'false'. If it is set to 'true', NETCONF notifications are supported by device, and NETCONF notifications are enabled ('enabled-notifications' flag), the connector would auto disconnect/reconnect when schemas are changed in the remote device. The connector subscribes (right after connect) to base netconf notifications and listens for netconf-capability-change notification
- **netconf-node-topology:streaming-session** - Default value of streaming-session parameter is set to 'false'. NETCONF session is created and optimized for receiving of NETCONF notifications from remote server.

### Other parameters

Other non-mandatory parameters that can be added to mount-request.

- **netconf-node-topology:schema-cache-directory** - This parameter
    can be used for two cases:
     1.  Explicitly set name of NETCONF cache directory. If it is not
         set, the name of the schema cache directory is derived from
         device capabilities during mounting process.
     2.  Direct usage of the 'custom' NETCONF cache directory stored in
         the UniConfig 'cache' directory by name. This 'custom'
         directory must exist, must not be empty and also can not use
         the 'netconf-node-topology:yang-module-capabilities'
         parameter, because capability names will be generated from
         yang schemas stored in the 'custom' directory.

- **netconf-node-topology:dry-run-journal-size** - Creates dry-run
    mount-point and defines number of NETCONF RPCs in history for
    dry-run mount-point. Value 0 disables dry-run functionality (it is
    default value).
- **netconf-node-topology:custom-connector-factory** - Specification of the custom NETCONF 
    connector factory. For example, if device doesn't support candidate data-store, 
    this parameter should be set to 'netconf-customization-alu-ignore-candidate' 
    string (default value is "default").
- **netconf-node-topology:edit-config-test-option** - Specification of
    the test-option parameter in the netconf edit-config message.
    Possible values are 'set', 'test-then-set' or 'test-only'. If the
    edit-config-test-option is not explicitly specified in the mount
    request, then the default value will be used ('test-then-set'). See
    [RFC-6241](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241#section-8.6) for more
    information about this feature.
- **netconf-node-topology:concurrent-rpc-limit** - Defines maximum number 
    of concurrent RPCs, where 0 indicates no limit (it is default value).

## Uninstalling Netconf device

### Example request

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8181/rests/operations/connection-manager:uninstall-node' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

```

## Installing gNMI device

### Identifying remote device

Basic connection parameters used to identify a remote device:

- `node-id` - Name of the node that represents the device/mountpoint in the topology.
- `gnmi-topology:host` - IP address or domain name of the target device running the gNMI server.
- `gnmi-topology:port` - TCP port where the gNMI server is listening to incoming connections.
- `gnmi-topology:device-type` - Specific device type. For now, only the `sonic` device type is supported. This parameter is used to create a device-type specific gNOI session. By default, this parameter is not specified.
- `gnmi-topology:connection-type` - If specified, an insecure connection is created. The insecure connection is available only for DEBUG reasons. To establish a gRPC connection without TLS, choose the insecure connection type `PLAINTEXT`. The connection type `PLAINTEXT` indicates that the target should skip the signature verification steps if a secure connection is used.
- `gnmi-topology:keystore-id` - If specified, a secure connection is created. Also requires `keystore-id` (identifier of the keystore), which is defined in the `gnmi-certificate-storage` model.

!!!
Only one of the parameters `keystore-id` and `connection-type` can be specified.
!!!

### Authentication parameters

Parameters to configure the basic authentication method against a gNMI server. These parameters must be specified in the input request inside the `gnmi-topology:credentials` container:

- `gnmi-topology:username` - Username with permission to access the device using gNMI.
- `gnmi-topology:password` - Password for username.

### Session timers

The following parameters adjust timers related to maintaining gNMI session state. None of these parameters are mandatory (default values are used if not specified):

- `gnmi-topology:request-timeout` - Timeout (in seconds) for each gNMI request. The request times out if not completed in time. The default value is 30.

### Flags

Non-mandatory flag parameters that can be added to a mount request:

- `gnmi-topology:enabled-notifications` - If set to `true` and the gNMI device supports notifications, the gNMI mountpoint will expose GNMI notification and subscription services. The default value is `true`.

### Other parameters

Other non-mandatory parameters that can be added to a mount request:

- `gnmi-topology:dry-run-journal-size` - Size of the dry-run gNMI mountpoint journal. The dry-run journal captures gNMI operations that would be executed when reading/writing a configuration. However, the operations are not actually sent to the device. The default value is 0.

### Extension parameters

Other extended non-mandatory parameters that can be added to a mount-request inside of the `extensions-parameters` container.

#### gNMI parameters

- `gnmi-topology:use-model-name-prefix` - Some devices require a module prefix in the first element name of the gNMI request path (for example, interfaces -> openconfig-interfaces:interfaces). The default value is `false`.

### UniConfig-native

Parameters related to installing gNMI nodes with uniconfig-native support:

- `uniconfig-config:uniconfig-native-enabled` - Whether or not uniconfig-native should be used for installing of NETCONF, CLI or gNMI nodes. The default value is `false`.
- `uniconfig-config:sequence-read-active` - Forces reading of data sequentially when mounting a device. If set to `true`, sync-from-network is done in parallel. The default value is `false`.
- `uniconfig-config:whitelist` - List of root YANG entities that should be read.
- `uniconfig-config:store-failed-installation` - Whether or not the installation is stored in the database if it fails (e.g., unreachable). The node is "installed" even though it fails, and the user has two options:
  - Uninstall the device and reinstall it.
  - Call `sync-from-network` to sync the data from the device.

!!!
An important install parameter is `gnmi-topology:schema-cache-directory: <folder-name>`. It specifies a folder name in the cache directory with the YANG schemas needed to install a device. 
!!!

### Update paths

This is a non-mandatory parameter that specifies a list of paths for which UniConfig will process intended changes as a gNMI SET message - Update operation. Paths are specified in regexp format. 

More information about update paths feature: <https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/user-guide/network-management-protocols/uniconfig_gnmi/#update-paths>.

### Replace paths

This is a non-mandatory parameter that specifies a list of paths for which UniConfig will process intended changes as a gNMI SET message - Replace operation. 

A specific replace diff implementation in UniConfig checks and merges all changes according to the specified `replace-paths`, and ensures that the gNMI SET message has the same path as the one specified in `replace-paths` in the install request.

Paths are specified in common RESTful URL format, but list entries can be compiled as a regexp pattern if specified with the `$` sign after the `=` sign. 

More information about the replace paths feature: <https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/user-guide/network-management-protocols/uniconfig_gnmi/#replace-paths>.


### Remove module name paths

This is a non-mandatory parameter that specifies a list of paths for which UniConfig removes the module name of specified list entry keys. (For example, `protocol=openconfig-policy-types:BGP,bgp`, remove-module-name-path = `network-instances/network-instance=$.*/protocols/protocol`).

The path format is the same as for `replace-paths`.

### All type paths

This is a non-mandatory parameter that specifies a list of paths for which UniConfig provides a GET request with the ALL data type.

The path format is the same as for `replace-paths`.

This feature only applies to the SONiC device type. 

### Dependency paths

This is a non-mandatory parameter that specifies list of paths for which UniConfig will check and order the intended changes.

The format of dependency paths: 
- `before` - path without keys that is ordered before the path specified in `after`.
- `after` - path without keys that is ordered after the path specified in `before`.

More information about dependency paths: <https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/user-guide/network-management-protocols/uniconfig_gnmi/#dependency-paths>.

## Installing SNMP agent

### Identification of remote agent

List of basic connection parameters that are used for identification of
remote agent.

- **node-id** - Name of node that represents device / mount-point in
  the topology.
- **snmp-topology:host** - IP address or domain-name of target
  device where SNMP agent is running.
- **snmp-topology:port** - SNMP port on which SNMP agent is listening 
  to incoming connections.

### SNMP parameters

- **snmp-topology:transport-type** - UniConfig currently supports UDP
  for SNMP communication, with plans to add TCP support in the future.
- **snmp-topology:snmp-version** - UniConfig currently supports V1 and
  V2c version of the SNMP, with plans to add V3 support in the future.
- **snmp-topology:connection-retries** - Sets the number of retries to 
  be performed before a request is timed out. Default value is 0.
- **snmp-topology:request-timeout** - Timeout in milliseconds before 
  a confirmed request is resent or timed out. Default value is 3000.
- **snmp-topology:get-bulk-size** - The maximum number of values 
  that can be returned in a single response to the get-bulk operation.
  Default value is 50.

### Authentication parameters

- **snmp-topology:community-string** - UniConfig currently supports only
  security string as authentication method that is used with V1 and
  V2c.

### Others

- **snmp-topology:mib-repository** - Name of the MIB repository that contains
  MIB files.

### Example request

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8181/rests/operations/connection-manager:install-node' \
